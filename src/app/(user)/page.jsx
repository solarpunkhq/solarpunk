        We are like tenant farmers chopping down the fence around our house for
        fuel when we should be using natures inexhaustible sources of energy –
        sun, wind and tide. I'd put my money on the sun and solar energy. What a
        source of power! I hope we don’t have to wait until oil and coal run out
        before we tackle that.

        <p>
          Our mission is to 100× the deployment of solar energy with the help of
          agrivoltaics. To achieve this, we are splitting our project into three
          phases to reduce risk, understand the market and achieve our Solarpunk
          future.
        </p>
        <h4>Phase 1: </h4>
        <p>
          The initial stage, Phase 1, revolves around the creation of a
          marketplace that connects landowners with energy partners.
        </p>
        <p>
          The intention is to connect landowners, our supply chain's core, with
          energy partners who make up the demand side. We aim to establish a
          thriving marketplace that is connecting both parties.
        </p>
        <p>
          A critical aspect of this phase is to identify whether supply or
          demand is the bottleneck inhibiting our growth.
        </p>
        <p>
          By understanding the potential constraints within our marketplace, we
          can develop strategic solutions to alleviate them. As we progress
          through this phase, we also place a strong emphasis on learning, as
          this experience will provide invaluable insights to guide our future
          actions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our business model for this phase is straightforward and rewarding for
          all parties involved. We take a small percentage as commission for
          each successful connection, ensuring we remain invested in the
          efficacy of each partnership we facilitate.
        </p>
        <h4>Phase 2:</h4>
        <p>
          Phase 2 focuses on addressing the technical challenges associated with
          agrivoltaics. The ultimate objective is to tackle the most demanding
          technical obstacles by raising venture funding and tackling the
          technical challenges with ongoing research and development.
        </p>
        <p>
          With financial backing, we aim to assemble a dedicated, highly-skilled
          team capable of overcoming these challenges. This phase&rsquo;s
          success would not only highlight our problem-solving capabilities but
          also enable us to develop prototypes based on the lessons learned
          during the initial phase.
        </p>
        <p>
          The goal of this stage is to apply the knowledge acquired from Phase
          1, construct an effective prototype, and market these prototypes to
          our initial partners. The most important goal is to{' '}
          <strong>
            drive down the cost of deployment by an order of magnitude.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <h4>Phase 3:</h4>
        <p>
          In Phase 3, we start to provide more services to become a full-stack
          energy company. Our primary strategy will be to leverage our newly
          developed technology to approach farmland owners and reduce the
          initial costs of agrivoltaic solar parks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our Phase 3 plan also includes the acquisition of more funding and
          debt to help launch solar parks, either run by us or by Solarpunk
          Franchise Partners.
        </p>
        <p>
          The goal of this phase is clear: 100× the deployment of solar energy
          with our full-stack energy company and drive down costs at scale. In
          each phase, our dedication to innovation, sustainability, and
          partnership is the driving force behind our mission.
